# Notes on the specification

Places where
[`language-subset.md`](../../docs/specs/compiled-pattern-language/language-subset.md)
is ambiguous, says two things, or cannot be implemented as written, with the
reading this crate chose. Where the document leaves a choice, the reading is the
one that accepts less. The crate implements the document as it stands at commit
`46ffb54cbd`.

## The front end (§3 to §6)

1. **A runtime call at module scope whose callee is a value** (§3.2).
   `module-scope:runtime-call` covers instantiating a pattern and binding a
   handler. A call of a factory value held in a module-scope constant is one of
   those, and only the callee's type shows it. Chosen: the entry is reported
   where the callee resolves by name, and the rest waits for types.
2. **An expression statement in tier R whose callee is not resolved** (§4.2).
   The document decides it by the callee's type. Chosen until types exist: a
   call of a local value or of an import the program does not hold is accepted.
3. **A computed key that names a module-scope constant** (§4.3). The key is
   static when the constant has a literal type. Chosen: a key rooted at a
   module-scope definition or an import is not reported, and any other key that
   is not a literal or a well-known key is `reactive:unsupported-expression`.
4. **A staged change through an authored function that tier R calls** (§5.2).
   `function-body:effect-in-computation` covers every effect such a function
   requests, so a staged change there needs no separate treatment. Nothing is
   open; the note records that the two cases share one report.
5. **`new` in a function that a frozen-data initializer runs** (§5.1).
   `function-body:constructor` is stated for tier F. Chosen: it is reported in
   an immediately invoked function and in a callback inside a frozen-data
   initializer too, and not in the initializer expression itself, where
   `new Map(...)` and a Fabric value class are the legal forms and any other
   `new` waits for the type rule of `module-scope:frozen-data-type`.
6. **A Fabric value class** (§4.4.4, §5.1). The document does not list the
   classes. Chosen: an import from `commonfabric` whose name begins with
   `Fabric`.
7. **Promotion, the two forms that need more than syntax** (§6.1). A `reduce`
   whose accumulator has a code type and an object literal with a key that is
   not static disqualify a `computed`. Chosen: neither is tested by the
   syntactic criterion, so `computed:redundant` can be reported for a body the
   type checker's criterion would not promote.

## The corpus (§11)

8. **The corpus has moved.** §11 was measured at commit `47776e6c9c`, with 425
   modules. `patterns/` at the commit this crate is on has 426, after a merge of
   the main branch. Run on the tree of the measured commit, the crate's counts
   differ from §11 only in the rows the notes below explain.
9. **`.get()` in the pattern body** (§11.4): 68 against 66. The two the crate
   does not count are inside the two immediately invoked functions of
   `patterns/dev/gideon-tests/test-helper-owned-jsx-iife-captures.tsx`, which
   are refused, so their content is not tier-R code.
10. **`map` callbacks in the pattern body** (§11.4): 326 against 325. The one
    the crate does not count is `.map(toMentionable)`, which has no callback
    body.
11. **Per-element bodies over plain values** (§11.3): 7 in 7 files against 8
    callbacks in 6 files. The crate reports per callback, and three are in
    `patterns/apps/weekly-calendar/weekly-calendar.tsx`. The document counts a
    collection that is a call result, and the crate decides those only for
    `Object.keys`, `Object.entries`, and `split`; the plainness of any other
    call result needs the body record of the function (§4.4.1).
12. **The split of the promotion table** (§11.5). The totals agree: 1,369
    promoted, 109 not, 15 in statement position. The crate counts a body under
    "guard" whenever it uses a guard, and a collection callback with a statement
    body as a disqualifying expression, so the rows differ by a few calls each.
